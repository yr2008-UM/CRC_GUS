# An atlas of gut microbial β-glucuronidases and the microbe-gmGUS-metabolite axis in colorectal cancer patients

## Abstract
Development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is accompanied by microbial and metabolic dysbiosis, with gut microbial β-glucuronidases (gmGUSs) potentially impacting carcinogenesis through de-glucuronidation of diverse important molecules. This study constructed an atlas of 550 gmGUSs from a public CRC cohort, employing 114 reference GUSs, three GUS domains, and seven conserved residues. Analysis along CRC stages revealed enrichment of Mini-Loop2 and GUS-harboring species Bacteroides cellulosilyticus and Bacteroides nordii, in late-stage. Moreover, 38 differential gmGUSs were identified totally, effectively classifying patients from controls (AUCs > 0.8). A GUSscore model based on five gmGUSs mainly from B. cellulosilyticus well predicted CRC outcomes (AUCs > 0.8). Notable gmGUS-associated genus-level shifts included reduced Lachnospira and Bifidobacterium, and increased Prevotella, Alistipes, and Fusobacterium. Particularly, several functional species were enriched in late-stage, including sulfate reducers, mucin and flavonoid degraders. Orthology-gmGUS-metabolite interactions revealed specific biological links in amino acid metabolism, vitamin biosynthesis, bacterial behavior, and LPS biosynthesis. These findings firstly define the disturbance of microbe-gmGUS-metabolite axis in colorectal tumorigenesis and its potential as early diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CRC.
